# SplitGPT Rules
This repository hosts the SplitGPT speedrun, inspired by the *NanoGPT speedrun*.

The challenge is to (collaboratively / competitively) search for the fastest algorithms to use 2 x (8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs) devices, at least 100 miles apart, to train a language model that attains 3.28 cross-entropy loss on the FineWeb validation set.
